# cl2nc

cl2nc is an open source command line Python program for converting Vaisala
CL51 and CL31 ceilometer DAT and HIS L2 files to NetCDF.

## Example

On the command-line:

```sh
cl2nc input.dat output.nc
```

where `input.dat` is a Vaisala CL51 or CL31 DAT file and `output.nc` is the name
of a NetCDF output file.

See [example.zip](example.zip) for an example input and output.

## Installation

It is recommended to run cl2nc on Linux.

### Linux

On Debian-derived distributions (Ubuntu, Devuan, ...), install the required
system packages with:

```sh
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip pipx
```

On Fedora, install the required system packages with:

```sh
sudo yum install python3 pipx
```

Install cl2nc:

```sh
pipx install cl2nc
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/man/man1
ln -s ~/.local/pipx/venvs/cl2nc/share/man/man1/cl2nc.1 ~/.local/share/man/man1/
```

Make sure that `$HOME/.local/bin` is included in the `PATH` environment
variable if not already. This can be done with `pipx ensurepath`.

You should now be able to run `cl2nc` and see the manual page with `man cl2nc`.

To uninstall:

```sh
pipx uninstall cl2nc
rm ~/.local/share/man/man1/cl2nc.1
```

### macOS

Open the Terminal. Install cl2nc with:

```sh
python3 -m pip install cl2nc
```

Make sure that `/Users/<user>/Library/Python/<version>/bin` is included in the
`PATH` environment variable if not already, where `<user>` is your system
user name and `<version>` is the Python version. This path should be printed
by the above command. This can be done by adding this line to the file
`.zprofile` in your home directory and restart the Terminal:

```sh
PATH="$PATH:/Users/<user>/Library/Python/<version>/bin"
```

You should now be able to run `cl2nc` and see the manual page with `man cl2nc`.

To uninstall:

```sh
python3 -m pip uninstall cl2nc
```

### Windows

Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org). In the installer, tick `Add
python.exe to PATH`.

Open Command Prompt from the Start menu. Install cl2nc with:

```sh
pip install cl2nc
```

You should now be able to run `cl2nc`.

To uninstall:

```sh
pip uninstall cl2nc
```

## Usage

cl2nc is a command line program to be run a terminal (Linux and macOS) or the
Command Prompt (Windows).

Synopsis:

`cl2nc` [`-chq`] [`--debug`] *input* *output* \
`cl2nc` `-h`|`--help`

*input* is an input `.dat` or `.his` (L2) file. *output* is an output `.nc` file.
If directories are supplied for *input* and *output*, all `.dat`, `.DAT`, `.his`
and `.HIS` files in *input* are converted to `.nc` files in *output*.

Options:

- `-c`: Enable DAT checksum verification (slow).
- `--debug`: Enable debugging output.
- `-h`, `--help`: Show help message and exit.
- `-q`: Run quietly (suppress output).

On Linux and macOS, see also the manual page with:

```sh
man cl2nc
```

## Variables

Please see Vaisala CL51 User's Guide for a complete description of the
variables.

The DAT files can alternatively contain values in feet
(instead of meters), in which case all values are converted by cl2nc to meters.

Time in DAT and HIS files is assumed to be UTC.

Missing values are encoded as NaN (floating-point variables) or -2147483648
(integer variables). The `_FillValue` attribute contains the missing value
used in the given variable.

DAT files produce the following NetCDF output:

## License

This software is open source and can be used, shared and modified freely
under the terms of the MIT License (see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)).

## Support

If you encouter any issues with cl2nc you can
contact me at Peter Kuma <<peter@peterkuma.net>>,
or submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/peterkuma/cl2nc/issues).

## Known issues

There are many different undocumented variants of the CL31/CL51 format in use.
cl2nc strives to support most of them, but if you encounter errors with your
data files, it might be because it is yet another variant. In such a case,
submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/peterkuma/cl2nc/issues).

## FAQ

### cl2nc fails with an exception.

Please make sure you that
the Python package netCDF4 is installed. If it still does not work
for you contact me: Peter Kuma <<peter@peterkuma.net>>.
There are small variations in the .DAT file format with instruments.
cl2nc may need to be modified to be able to read a particular type of format.

### Where is the height information?

Height can be determined from [vertical_resolution](#vertical_resolution).
The instrument samples vertical bins on regular intervals.

### MATLAB cannot read the time_utc variable.

MATLAB NetCDF implementation currently does not support reading NC_STRING
variables. You can use the `time` variable instead or use the MATLAB HDF
functions to read the file (you may need to change the file extension to `.h5`).
