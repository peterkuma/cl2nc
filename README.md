# cl2nc

cl2nc is an open source command line Python program for converting Vaisala
CL51 and CL31 ceilometer dat files to NetCDF.

## Example

On the command-line:

```sh
cl2nc input.dat output.nc
```

where `input.dat` is a Vaisala CL51 or CL31 dat file and `output.nc` is the name
of a NetCDF output file.

See [example.zip](example.zip) for an example input and output.

## Installation

Supported operating systems:

- Linux
- Windows
- macOS

Requirements:

- Python 2.7 or Python 3

On Windows and macOS [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
distribution of Python is recommended. On Linux, use Python
which comes with your Linux distribution (either built-in, or installed through
a package manager).

The following commands should be run in the **Terminal** (Linux and macOS)
or **Anaconda Prompt** (Windows – you can find Anaconda Prompt in the
Start menu). To install with Python 3 instead of Python 2, replace `pip` with
`pip3` and `python` with `python3` in the commands below.

To install from the
[Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cl2nc):

```sh
pip install cl2nc
```

or to install in the user's home directory
(make sure `~/.local/bin` is in the `PATH` environment variable):

```sh
pip install cl2nc --user
```

Alternatively, to install from source, download and unpack the latest
[cl2nc](https://github.com/peterkuma/cl2nc/archive/master.zip) archive, or
clone the repository from GitHub
(`git clone https://github.com/peterkuma/cl2nc.git`). In the package
directory, run the following commands:

```sh
pip install netCDF4
python setup.py install

# or to install in the user's home directory
# (make sure `~/.local/bin` is in the `PATH` environment variable):

python setup.py install --user
```

You can also use the Python script `cl2nc` directly without installation
(as long as netCDF4 is installed).

Once installed, you should be able to run `cl2nc` in the Terminal
(Linux and macOS) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows).

## Usage

```sh
cl2nc [-chq] [--debug] [--help] <input> <output>
```

`<input>` is an input `.dat` file. `<output>` is an output `.nc` file.
If directories are supplied for `<input>` and `<output>`, all `.dat` and `.DAT`
files in `<input>` are converted to `.nc` files in `<output>`.

Options:

- `-c`: Enable checksum verification (slow).
- `--debug`: Enable debugging output.
- `-h`, `--help`: Show help message and exit.
- `-q`: Run quietly (suppress output).

A manual page is also available if cl2nc is installed on unix-like operating
systems:

```sh
man cl2nc
```

## Variables

Please see Vaisala CL51 User's Guide for a complete description of the
variables.

The DAT files can alternatively contain values in feet
(instead of meters), in which case all values are converted by cl2nc to meters.

Time in DAT files is assumed to be UTC.

Missing values are encoded as NaN (floating-point variables) or -2147483648
(integer variables). The `_FillValue` attribute contains the missing value
used in the given variable.

## Support

If you encouter any issues with cl2nc you can

or submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/peterkuma/cl2nc/issues).

## FAQ

### cl2nc fails with an exception.

Please make sure you that 
the Python package netCDF4 is installed. If it still does not work
for you contact me: Peter Kuma <<peter.kuma@fastmail.com>>.
There are small variations in the .DAT file format with instruments.
cl2nc may need to be modified to be able to read a particular type of format.

### Where is the height information?

Height can be determined from [vertical_resolution](#vertical_resolution).
The instrument samples vertical bins on regular intervals.

### MATLAB cannot read the time_utc variable.

MATLAB NetCDF implementation currently does not support reading NC_STRING
variables. You can use the `time` variable instead or use the MATLAB HDF
functions to read the file (you may need to change the file extension to `.h5`).

## Changelog

cl2nc follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).
